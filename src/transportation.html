            <h2>Getting To Taniti</h2>
            <p>
                Visitors to Taniti have multiple options for reaching the island, with 
                air travel being the most common. Taniti’s small but functional airport 
                accommodates both small jets and propeller planes, making it an 
                accessible destination for travelers seeking a tropical getaway. For 
                those arriving by sea, a charming small cruise ship docks weekly in 
                Yellow Leaf Bay, offering a picturesque overnight stay. Excitingly, the 
                island is in the process of expanding its airport to welcome larger 
                jets in the near future, promising even greater ease of access for 
                visitors eager to experience the beauty of Taniti.

                every traveler's needs. Public buses operate in Taniti City daily from

                Taxis are readily available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be 
                secured from a local agency near the airport for those looking to
